My development process started by making the home page and then copying it for the other pages and altering them to fit. My theme was supposed to be a prfessional code portfolio but I don't think it came across well since I struggled to make it look good with only HTML. I think I was able to meet all of the requirements but I admit it does not look as good as it would with CSS. Since the appearence was my greatest difficulty, I tried to fix it by adding 1-element tables so I could form some color blocks to make it look better and make the pages have a consistent theme. I think it did help.
